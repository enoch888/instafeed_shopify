# How to Instagram feed on your website?
This is a free code to add instagram feed to your website. A non coder can also do this by following a simple steps mentioned below.

## Installation
* Go to Admin of your shopify store and edit the code of the theme you want to add the feeds to.
* Create a new Section named ishi_instafeed.liquid.
* Empty the default contents of the newly created section file.
* Copy the content of the file ishi_instafeed.liquid from the repository and paste it to the newly created section.
* Create instagram access token from your facebook app and replace "YOUR_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE" with your generated access token. If you are not aware of generating access tokens, See [Managing Instagram Access Token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ndbJAnQKM)
* Now go to theme customiser and add a new section. From the list of available sections, search for "Ishi Instagram Block" and add it.
* Save the changes and check your store Homepage. You will see the instagram feeds from your account to your shopify store.
